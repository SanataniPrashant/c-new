// ==>>  ARRAY : 
// =>  It is a collection of similar kind of data element.
// =>  The indexing of array starts from 0.
// =>  The memory allocation of array is contiguous / sequentially. The data stored in sequence.
// =>  It is used to store multiple value.
// =>  With the help of array we can search the data quickly .\
// =>  There are to types of array :
// 1.  Numetric Array : 
//                      1. 1 Diamentional Array
//                      2. 2 Diamentional Array
//                      3. 3 Diamentional Array
// {
//     It is less secure because It can be accessed through its index value which is univesally known that it satarts from zero and sequentially inceases.
// }
// 2.  Associative array
// {
//     It is more secure because It is accessed through its key(It is unique and random and cannot reapeate).
// }
